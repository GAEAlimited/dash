At onout, we believe that the key to success is offering value to our customers. That's why we have adopted a pay-per-transaction model for our software, where we charge a small fee for each transaction made by the end user.

With this model, we are able to align our revenue with the value our software provides to the customer, ensuring that we are only earning revenue from those who are actively using our product and generating value from it. This model also makes our software more accessible to customers who may only use it infrequently, as they only pay for what they use.

per-per-transaction model:

1 Aligned revenue with user value: By charging a small fee for each transaction made by the end user, we can align our revenue with the value our software provides to the user. This ensures that we are only earning revenue from customers who are actively using our product and generating value from it.

2 Increased adoption and usage: A pay-per-transaction model may be more attractive to customers who may only use the software infrequently, as they only pay for what they use. This can increase adoption and usage of our software, leading to a larger customer base and increased revenue over time.

3 Better understanding of customer needs: By tracking the number and type of transactions made by our users, we can gather valuable information about their needs and preferences. This information can be used to improve our product and increase customer satisfaction.

4 Flexibility: A pay-per-transaction model offers greater flexibility in our pricing strategy, allowing us to adjust the fee structure to reflect changes in the market or our business goals.
